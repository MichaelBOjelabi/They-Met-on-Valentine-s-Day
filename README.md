# They-Met-on-Valentine-s-Day
I love you because you love me and understand me, because you support me and assist me, because you trust me and refuse to doubt me, and most probably because you make me feel good whenever we are together.  I may also love you just for who you are, what you mean to me, and because of a lot of reasons that makes me accept and appreciate you. The Bible speaks very much about God and His great love for mankind, despite our great shortcomings. As the Creator and Maker of man and his universe or environment, God is also the true embodiment of life and love.  As the standard of truth and the full measure of love, God’s love for man is without condition. He loves man to give him every good thing essential for his joy and happiness in the Garden of Eden. It was out of love that he created man with a freedom of choice, rather than give him an existence like a zombie’s.
